                        Sarah founded Changing Life Home Care in 2020 with her Cousin, Kwaku. Before starting the agency, Sarah became certified nurse assistants (CNAs) and through hard work she went back to school and came back with <em>RN , BSN , MBA and MSN</em>  .With all these success, she was doing this all by her self until she was able to hire additional home health aide.
                        <br> <br> This firsthand caregiving experience has been critical in Sarah’s understanding of the care needs of clients and their families, and the challenges and rewards of being a professional caregiver. Through her close work with seniors, Sarah has gained unique insight into how to help older adults live comfortably and safely at home with appropriate services and support.
